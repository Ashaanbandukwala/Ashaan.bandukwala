          <p>I have many hobbys such as Taekwondo,Drums,Coding, Oragami and Soccer. But my favorite is taekwondo because i've been doing it for soo long; Its exhilarating and its active. These are just some of the reasons I love Taekwondo. One of my favorite memories are when I used to come home from school and I would eat then sit on the couch and wait till my Dad came and picked me and my brothers up and go to taekwondo class. I am 12 years old and im a second degree blackbelt; Iv been doing taekwondo for 9 years and I hope to continue for many more years to come. </p></section>
